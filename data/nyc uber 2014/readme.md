# NYC Uber data for months May-July 2014

The data has been retained in its original format of a month having its own .csv file,
however to make my life slightly easier when using all of these data, I've combined these files into [merged.csv](./merged.csv)

## Example:

``` csv
"Date/Time","Lat","Lon","Base"
"5/1/2014 0:02:00",40.7521,-73.9914,"B02512"
"5/1/2014 0:06:00",40.6965,-73.9715,"B02512"
"5/1/2014 0:15:00",40.7464,-73.9838,"B02512"
"5/1/2014 0:17:00",40.7463,-74.0011,"B02512"
"5/1/2014 0:17:00",40.7594,-73.9734,"B02512"
```
